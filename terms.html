        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>

        <p>By downloading, installing, or using DiamondCheck AI ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

        <p>DiamondCheck AI is a diamond evaluation tool that analyzes GIA-certified diamond certificates and provides analysis reports including quality assessments, market price estimates, and purchasing guidance. The App uses optical character recognition to extract data from certificates and applies proprietary evaluation algorithms to generate reports.</p>

        <h2>2. Informational Purposes Only</h2>

        <p><strong>The App is provided for informational and educational purposes only.</strong> Diamond evaluations, price estimates, grades, and recommendations provided by the App are algorithmic assessments based on available data and should not be considered professional appraisals, certifications, or guarantees of value.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Price estimates are derived from market data and may not reflect actual dealer or retail pricing in your area</li>
            <li>Quality grades are the App's independent assessment and may differ from GIA or other laboratory grades</li>
            <li>The App does not replace professional gemological evaluation by a certified appraiser</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for purchasing decisions made based on App reports</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>

        <p>The App offers premium analysis reports available through in-app purchases. Report credits are managed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Purchases are non-refundable except as required by applicable law or Apple's refund policy</li>
            <li>Report credits do not expire</li>
            <li>Each credit entitles you to one full analysis report for one diamond</li>
            <li>New users receive one complimentary report credit</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Accuracy and Limitations</h2>

        <p>While we strive to provide accurate analysis, the App has inherent limitations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>OCR extraction depends on certificate image quality and may occasionally misread values</li>
            <li>Market price data is updated periodically and may not reflect real-time prices</li>
            <li>The App evaluates round brilliant diamonds based on GIA certificates; results for other shapes, labs, or non-certified diamonds may be less accurate</li>
            <li>Inclusion analysis from clarity plot scanning is an approximation and does not replace microscopic examination</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>All content, algorithms, evaluation methods, user interface designs, and code within the App are the intellectual property of DiamondCheck AI. You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract any proprietary algorithms or data from the App.</p>

        <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for verifying extracted certificate data before relying on analysis results</li>
            <li>You agree not to use the App for fraudulent purposes or to misrepresent diamond values</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any data stored by the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DIAMONDCHECK AI AND ITS DEVELOPERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSSES FROM DIAMOND PURCHASES MADE BASED ON APP REPORTS.</p>

        <h2>9. Modifications</h2>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>

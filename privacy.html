        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>

        <p>DiamondCheck AI ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Certificate Images:</strong> When you scan a GIA diamond certificate using the camera or select one from your photo library, the image is processed entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework for optical character recognition (OCR). Certificate images are never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Diamond Data:</strong> The diamond specifications extracted from certificates (such as carat weight, color, clarity, and cut grades) are stored locally on your device to provide scan history and analysis features. This data is not transmitted off your device.</p>

        <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> In-app purchases are handled entirely by Apple's App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID. We only receive confirmation from Apple that a purchase was completed to grant report credits.</p>

        <p><strong>App Preferences:</strong> We use Apple's UserDefaults to store basic app preferences on your device, such as whether you have completed onboarding and your remaining report credit balance. This data stays on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>

        <p>The App requests access to your device's camera and photo library solely for the purpose of scanning GIA diamond certificates. Images captured or selected are processed locally on your device and are not stored by the App beyond the immediate scanning session, unless you choose to save a scan to your history.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p><strong>Rapaport Price Data:</strong> The App connects to Rapaport's pricing API to retrieve current diamond market prices. This connection transmits only diamond specifications (color, clarity, carat weight, cut grade) to retrieve pricing data. No personal information is sent to Rapaport.</p>

        <p><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> In-app purchases are processed by Apple under their own privacy policy. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how Apple handles purchase data.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>All diamond data and app preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms (the app's sandboxed document directory and UserDefaults). We do not operate servers that store your personal data. Your scan history and report data remain on your device and are removed when you delete the App.</p>

        <h2>5. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs</li>
            <li>We do not collect location data</li>
            <li>We do not use advertising identifiers</li>
            <li>We do not share or sell any data to third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>

        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mizrahidiamonds@icloud.com">mizrahidiamonds@icloud.com</a>.</p>
